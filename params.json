{"name":"Mathematica-Fa14","tagline":"","body":"All workshops will be held in L440 Digital Computer Laboratory, an EWS computer laboratory in the basement.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# Access to *Mathematica*\r\n\r\n[*Wolfram Mathematica*](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is available for students at the University of Illinois in the [Engineering Workstation](it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews) computer laboratories, and also for download from the [UI Webstore](https://webstore.illinois.edu/Shop/product.aspx?zpid=2633).\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to *Wolfram Mathematica*](#intro)\r\n### Nov. 13, 10:00 am–Noon • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students who have some background in programming concepts (loops, functions, and variables).  (If you know MATLAB, Python, or another language, you'll be fine.)  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what *Mathematica* has to offer and then work through some applications of *Mathematica*'s capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Variables, data types, tables, functions\r\n- Plotting\r\n- Rules (the core concept of *Mathematica*)\r\n- Built-in libraries & technical data\r\n- Equation and differential equation solution\r\n- Physical applications\r\n\r\nNotebooks:\r\n\r\n- [Whirlwind Tour]()\r\n- [DNA String (Replacement Rules)]()\r\n- [Heat Equation (ODE Solution)]()\r\n- [Pendulum (ODE Solution)]()\r\n- [Hanging Chain (Special Functions, ODE Solution)]()\r\n- [Steam Table (Interpolation)]()\r\n- [Exercises]()\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nNeal Davis and Rishabh Narang developed these materials.
